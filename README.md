New error messages can be added using the ```Sentry.capture_exception()``` or ```Sentry.capture_message()``` methods:
```
def test_sentry 
  begin 
    1 / 0 
  rescue ZeroDivisionError => exception 
    Sentry.capture_exception(exception) 
   end
end
```
or

```Sentry.capture_message("This is the error message that is sent to Sentry")```
